### ● Privacy ● AdTech ● FinTech ● E-Commerce


Boasting over 20 + years of expertise in developing large-scale software solutions, I bring more than a decade of experience in creating products from the ground up. I have successfully engineered 7 substantial products leveraging microservices architecture. Notably, I led the incremental migration to new technology stacks for 3 of these products, achieving seamless transitions without disrupting business operations.


#### ● Enterprise Architecture ● Technology Direction ● Execution & Delivery

As a distinguished engineering leader, I bring a unique combination of technology, product management, people management, and entrepreneurial acumen. My extensive expertise encompasses backend and frontend development, databases, testing, big data, networking, cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and security architecture. This diverse skill set empowers me to strategically plan and execute initiatives with remarkable efficiency. With over a decade of executive experience, I am adept at identifying, evaluating, and securing consensus for cutting-edge technologies and enterprise systems that streamline business processes and drive strategic success.



### Technical Expertise and Notable Achievements:

- **Autoscalable Java AdServer:-** Built a `multi-tenant` `AdServer` from scratch in `Java`, serving `400 RPS` on a `cloud VPS (2GB RAM, 2 VCPUs)` with an average response time of `80-200ms`. Achieved this with a team of `8` within a year, incorporating load testing and performance optimizations.
- **Static Code Analysis:-** Contributed to `joern.io` framework by adding support for `Go`, and `Ruby` from scratch, as well as worked on memory & performance optimization.
- **Scale and Performance Optimisation:-** Improved the load handling capacity from 100 simultaneous users to 2000 users for `ugaoo.com` along with page speed optimization. Adserving from `70 RPS` to `400 RPS` from the same `2GB RAM` and `2 VCPU` machine. Using async processing stabilized the setup for `cARscan` and increased load
handling capacity from `10 RPS` to `250 RPS`. Worked on multiple performance optimization and memory optimizations to make static code analysis work for very big code bases of different customers.
- **Revenue:-** Supported by technology to scale revenue of `ugaoo.com` from `10k USD` to `1M USD` per month. With tech stack migration improved the loan disbursal capacity from `50K USD` to `1M USD` a month for `gromor` finance. Similarly for `cARscan` supported revenue scale from `30K USD` to `800K USD` per year.
- **Technology Stack Migration:-** Led the migration of `Gromor's` tech stack from `PHP` to `Java/GWT` in `6 months`, training the existing team and ensuring no business `interruptions` during the incremental migration. Similarly, for `cARscan`, migrated their Python stack to `Java` and `Angular` in `8 months`.
- **Cloud Migration:-** Executed a `live migration` of the entire cloud infrastructure from Rackspace to Microsoft Azure without downtime.
- **Project Setup & DevOps:-** Successfully set up projects from scratch, incorporating unit testing frameworks and implementing `DevOps` processes using `Docker`, `AWS CodePipeline`, and `AWS ECS clusters`. Streamlined development with dockerized containers, enabling local development with multiple microservices in under 10 minutes. `Agnie`, `Gromor`, `YuktaMedia`, `ugaoo.com`, `cARscan`, and `Privado`.
- **Infra Cost Optimization:-** Reduced infrastructure costs by code optimization, `devops`, `alerting`, `distributed architecture`, `autoscaling`, `ECS cluster` with `fargate`, easy dev setup with `docker`, using `CDN`, using `ARM` processors, `right-sizing`, & auto shutdown of unused instances. Improved infra cost by 30% for `gromor`, by 60% for `cARscan`, by 20% for `YuktaMedia`.
- **Entrepreneurial Ventures:-** Extensive `startup` experience, demonstrating `leadership` in launching products, managing teams, and driving `innovation` in fast-paced environments.
- **Training & Data Architecture:-** Imparted technical `training` to internal teams for upskilling on Java, J2EE, Spring, GWT, React, KnockoutJS, Web technologies (JS, HTML, and HTTP protocol), Magento, Shopify, Big Data, & DevOps. Refer some recorded [sessions](https://www.youtube.com/@pandurangpatil/videos)
- **Task Queue Processor Mechanism:-** Developed a unique `task queue processor` mechanism using MongoDB, enabling robust error retry management for asynchronous tasks. Applied this solution across various projects including `IDeaS`, `gromor`, `cARscan`, & `YuktaMedia`.
