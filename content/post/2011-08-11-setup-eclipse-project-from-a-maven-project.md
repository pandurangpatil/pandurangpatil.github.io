Note: Below steps will work for 2.x and later version's of Maven
project.


**Assumption: You know eclipse.**

  

Eclipse version details: I would recommend to use latest version of Eclipse (Helios was the latest version while writing this blog and steps are tried with the same).

  
If you know how to install eclipse plugin then you can skip install steps and install following two pluginsÂ 

1. http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e
2. http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e-extras

**Install maven eclipse [plug-in](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html) for more details [refer](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html).**

Follow below steps to install eclipse plug-in.

-   similarly install m2eclipse Extras URL (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e-extras). 


Once you install both the eclipse plug-ins for Maven your eclipse is ready to import Maven project. When you install those plug-in's it also installs Embedded Maven and it uses the same for imported projects. If you want to use other version of maven which installed on your machine. You can do the same follow below steps to select installed version of
Maven.
