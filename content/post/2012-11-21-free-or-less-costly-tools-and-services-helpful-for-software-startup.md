When you are looking to start on your own Software Start-up you need to
look for what all free services, tools that can be help full to start
with as saving on Money is very important for a startup.  
  

Most important for any start-up is to have email for their custom
domain. And I suppose most of the people know which is the best and free
option to start with [Google
Apps](http://www.google.com/intl/en_in/enterprise/apps/business/pricing.html)
<span style="color: black;">for 10 users</span>

-   Its the custom gmail for your domain and you have most of the other
    free service from Google available with it like Google Drive,
    Calendar, Task and Sites.

Most important for Software start-up is where to keep or host source
code repository. And most use full and feature free service upto 5 users
that I was able locate is <https://bitbucket.org/>. It has following
features

-   Free private source code repository hosting upto 5 users with
    mercurial.
-   It has Wiki pages hosting not that great but can be useful.
-   Up to some extent you can have access management on repository.
-   It comes with Jira integeration, which good amount features which
    can make your life easy to trac the issue and changes.
-   You can add commit commands while committing the code which can
    link, resolve the respective issue in JIRA.
-   It has services like send commit mail, send diff and issue update
    notifications.
-   Most importantly you can have unlimited private repositories.
-   You can even configure custom domain.
-   And it also supports code review process. 

The product you are developing is having GUI to interact with then most
probably you would also require to create mock pages. So that it will be
easier for you to communicate and help full to get your imagination on
paper before you give it a finishing touch. I found one such tool very
help full <https://gomockingbird.com/>.

-   It is a web based service, so you can access it from anywhere.
-   You can easily drag and drop the widgets and design the page very
    fast.
-   Most important feature which I liked about it is to link one page
    corresponding hyper link or tab on other page.
-   You can collaborate with other people.
-   You can download pdf file / images.
-   It is a paid service, which start with 9$/ Month for 2 active
    projects and unlimited collaborators. But most important part is you
    can archive your project, in case you are not going to work on it
    for a month or more than a month. If you don't have any active
    project for any month you don't have to pay for that month. You can
    reactivate archived project and work on it again.

Project planner you can have
[tom'splanner](http://www.tomsplanner.com/software/project-planning/pricingsignup.aspx)
to start with free of cost.

If you are working in group in different remote location, you might need
to share the screen and have group meetings in that case you can use
following service free of cost for screen share.

-   You can use skype screen share
-   You have [join.me](http://join.me/) but its not supported to share
    screen from Linux machine.
-   One recent tool I found was [Google Chrome Remote
    Desktop](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp)
    you will require to use Google Chrome browser. With this you can
    actually control remote desktop.

If yours is the web application which you want to host some where on
internet. Either you can host it in house our use hosting service.
Hosting in house requires lot of investment and its time and money
consuming from the point of maintaining it initially. It may be worth
having it if you are big enough to handle it. Following are few services
which I found which can be cost effective.

To start with you can think of using [Google App
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/pricing/index) but it depends what kind
of storage you are going to use. If your application requires to use
Mysql then I find Google service to be costly but you can use App Engine
Data Store using either JDO or JPA with some some limitation. Like it
doesn't support Many to Many relationships, Join Queries etc.

If you are looking for some VPS service then I was able to locate few
cost effective good Services 

-   One is intovps <http://www.intovps.com/> starts with 512 MB RAM, 30
    GB RAID 10 Storage, 500 GB Monthly traffic, 1 Static IP and root SSH
    access 10$ / Month. Available to host in Fremont CA, Dallas TX,
    London UK, Amsterdam NL and Bucharest RO.
-   Other one is yardvps <http://www.yardvps.com/> starts 512 RAM, 1 CPU
    core, 20 GB RAID 10 storage, 1500 GB bandwidth, 1 static IP etc with
    around 8$ / Month.

If you are looking for CDN then <https://www.cloudflare.com/> is free
and very good service you can use as a CDN.

       I will update it as and when I get some more information. It
would be also helpful for me if any body who is reading this blog has
some more information or other feedback about above mentioned service it
would be helpful for me to know it.
