First of all I tried this site to convert blogger site content to hugo or markdown format

git clone git@github.com:palaniraja/blog2md.git

I followed the insructions 

1. downloaded the blogger export xml file
2. installed prerequisites to run blog2md
3. as per instruction invoked this tool to migrate blogger.com posts to markdown - node index.js b|w /media/pandurang/Primary-Data/ubuntu-local-setup-jan-25/projects/temp/blog-02-08-2025.xml /media/pandurang/Primary-Data/ubuntu-local-setup-jan-25/projects/temp/pandurangpatil


However it didn't workout. 

I got another tool from the hugo site

https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/

blogger-to-hugo

I followed the link to https://pypi.org/project/blogger-to-hugo/#description

Did the installation with following steps


1. sudo apt install python3-pip
2. pip install blogger-to-hugo => this will install the binaries to users local home folder so use the right path to invoke the utility
3. <home folder>/.local/bin/blogger-to-hugo -h will give you the input parameters this tool takes
4. <home folder>/.local/bin/blogger-to-hugo <path to xml file exported from blogger.com> <new folder path where migrated contents will be written>


Most important this will also download the images
